# OSI Model task

## Describe any layered process similar to the OSI model

### TCP/IP

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.

Just like the OSI model, the TCP/IP is divided into layers (four) namely:

- **The Application layer** : Provides applications with standardized data exchange e.g HTTP.
- **The Transport layer** : Maintains end-end communication across the network.
- **The Network Layer** : Transports packets across independent network boundaries.
- **The Physical Layer** : Interconnects hosts to the network. e.g Ethernet on local networks.
