## THE TCP/IP MODEL

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol. TCP/IP Stack is specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internet work. The functionality of the TCP IP model is divided into four
layers, and each includes specific protocols. TCP/IP is a layered server architecture system in which each layer is defined according to a specific function to perform. All these four TCP IP layers work collaboratively to transmit the data from one layer to another

* Application Layer
* Transport Layer
* Internet Layer
* Network Interface
