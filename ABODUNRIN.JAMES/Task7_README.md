# Fundamentals of UIUX (My article)

## User Experience (UX) can be stated or simply put is how a user using your product feels while interacting with your product. The major goal of UX is to ensure the product is usable, enjoyable, equitable and accessible.

This means before we can have an effective User Experience Design, the following need to be considered

*  Know your user: The audience we are making a product for matters at the center of our design, hence it is crucial to put all possible users into maximum consideration when creating a product. Ability and Inability of all category of users will be considered here, thereby bringing in an equitable design system
* Focus and prioritize your Users:  There should be a research system that enables a UX designer to learn more about their product users either through questionnaire, interview or observations. There is need to consider their story, understand their pain points in their story and emotional gesture they put on during the research process. The UX designer should not think or assume the users will use the product the same way they use the product
* Empathize with your User: Empathy is the ability to understand someone else’s feelings or thoughts in a situation. When you empathize with someone, you share their mental and emotional experiences. UX design is not about solving problems we assume users want solved, it is about solving problems that users actually want solved. You can empathize with your users by asking a lot of questions, being an active listener, having an open mind, becoming more observant and requesting input from a variety of sources and diverse group of users.


The above stated focus of the UX design can be further, for clarity,categorized into the 5 stages of the Design thinking process:

* Empathize: This involves the interaction of the UX designer with the product users to understand how they feel about a product or a competitive product and what they might desire to have better or be total changed. This is carried out through UX research. This will help to have a User centered design system
* Define: When done with the empathy stage, we will be able to define what the user problem is by organizing and sorting all problem statements generated from our UX research at the empathy stage
* Ideate: This is where the UX designer or researcher tend to brainstorm through critical thinking on all possible ways to solve the user problems they are able to define in the previous stage
* Prototype: This is what I will call a reality stage, where all relatively acceptabed ideas are turn into reality. In this stage, there is a model or working model called prototyping carried out after which we are done with wireframing our ideas. It shows how a particular feature in a product or a product itself will work
* Test: At this stage our prototype is been test with actual users to better know I the features in the product or the product itself is able to meet the users need

## User Interface (UI) is the visual representation of a digital product or any kind of product. UI is the link between the user and the functionality of a product. UI is all that we experience mostly with our eyes. User Interface is the use of grid, typography, colors, layout and animations to create products that are easy to use and pleasing to the users’ eyes.

A UI designer is responsible for the look and feel of the product. UI design involves anticipating the user’s preferences and creating an interface that both understands and fulfills them. Precision, attention to detail and careful planning are all necessary. Readability, useful and aesthetically pleasing result is the climax of a successful UI design. A successful user interface should be intuitive, efficient and user-friendly.
The following can be better termed as the fundamentals of  UI design

* Know Your Users.: Acquire a good knowledge and understanding about your users and their needs so that you can design to meet those needs. In addition, you should keep your users in control. Keep your users in control by disclosing system status on a frequent basis, describing causation, and providing insight into what to expect at every step
* Keep It Simple: Great user interfaces are almost imperceptible. They are not extravagant, overly embellished, or encumbered with frills. They only include the most important information, which is presented in a logical and simple manner. Do not add things to feed your ego or to be clever
* Consistency is Key: Since people establish habits rapidly, it is critical to maintain consistency throughout the product. Users may locate and stay in their comfort zone with consistent interfaces throughout a session. People seek consistency, therefore provide it to them so they can focus on the content rather than how to get there
* Hierarchy: Make it a point to draw attention to the most crucial interface elements so that users can find and concentrate on them. There are varieties of design approaches you can take to accomplish this. Making a key button larger or brightly colored to make it stand out is a basic example
* Understand the Rules of Perception: Rules of perception are perceptive mechanisms our mind uses to connect and organize partial information into a coherent whole. The human brain tries to connect the dots. We must be able to back up our design decisions with evidence. Knowing the rules of perception can make it much easier to justify our decisions and avoid numerous typical blunders. By putting that knowledge to use, we can improve and simplify our designs
