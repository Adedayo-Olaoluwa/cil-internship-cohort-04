# Cloud Computing
This is the delivery of IT resources over the Internet. The cloud is like a virtual data center accessible via the Internet that allows you to manage:

- Storage services like databases
- Servers, compute power, networking
- Analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality
- Security services for data and applications

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- Pay as you go - You pay only for what you use and only when your code runs.
- Autoscaling - The number of active servers can grow or shrink based on demand.
- Serverless - Allows you to write and deploy code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## Classification of Cloud Servicess
Cloud computing services comes with a collection of advantages, and features set to satisfy the particular requirements of various enterprises. It provides versatility by the different types of services that make cloud computing efficient and viable IT solutions.

It gives liberty to enterprises to define how, where, when, and to what extent they want to adopt this technology.  
Cloud services can generally be categorized into three broad classifications. Which are:   

### Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS)
This category of cloud computing services uses the internet to provide virtualized computing resources. It delivers compute, network and storage resources to customers on demand. It's a pay as you go model. You are charged based on the amount of compute service you use.  
IaaS allows users to scale and shrink resources on an as-needed basis, reducing the need for high, up-front capital expenditures or unnecessary “owned” infrastructure, especially in the case of “spiky” workloads.   

### Platform As A Service (PAAS)
PaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, is a cloud computing model that provides users a complete cloud platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure—for developing, running, and managing applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility that often comes with building and maintaining that platform on-premises.  
PaaS helps scalability by its design, making it suitable for businesses that want to maintain a lean operation. It is ideal for companies that revolve around leveraging existing data sources or involving projects demanding inputs from various developers.  

### Software As A Service (SAAS)
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a cloud-based way of providing software to users. SaaS users only need to subscribe to an application rather than purchasing, installing, and maintaining.  
Software as a service (SaaS) is the most commonly used option for businesses in the cloud market. The reason? It’s easily accessible – all you need is an internet connection and a browser – and it’s hands-off.
