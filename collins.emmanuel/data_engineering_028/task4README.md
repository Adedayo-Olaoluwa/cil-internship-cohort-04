Do an extensive comparison on the different use cases for different kinds of databases


1. 	Relational Database

Relational (SQL) Databases such as Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite, organize data into tables with columns, each with a specified name and datatype.

- Some of the use cases of relational databases compared to other databases is that relational databases use mature technology that is widely understood and well-documented, SQL standards are well-defined, defined constraints enforce data integrity, they avoid data duplication and are highly secure and ACID-compliant.

- Another highly important use cases for the relational database is situations where data integrity is absolutely paramount (financial applications, defense and security, private health information), highly structured data, and automation of internal processes.

- Relational database management systems (RDBMS) provide a cornerstone for many apps and services. By technology standards, RDBMS are ancient. Strong theoretical underpinnings have kept RDBMS technologies relevant in a volatile industry. Even non-relational data stores have had to add RDBMS-like features. For example, Hadoop has a SQL interface.

Even though RDBMS are popular and versatile, they don’t solve every problem.


2. 	GRAPH DATABASE USE CASES
a. Fraud Detection: Fraud detection at banks and even login mechanisms, like Facebook, seem to work rather well. They send you a notice when there is suspicious activity on your account and then decline your, for example, credit card. Then you would have to contact your bank and confirm that you are really who you claim to be and this is you trying to make an online purchase and not a hacker. It does this using different algorithms designed to crawl the nodes and edges of a graph model to flag suspicious activity.

b. Real-time Recommendation Engines: This happens when online platforms search through your viewing and purchasing history, and people deemed to be smilar to you, to recommend items you might want to view or purchase next. Netflix looks at IMDB. Amazon looks at what people who have purchased the item you just bought.

c. Master Data Management & Identity Management: This is a use case mentioned by Neo4J, DataStax, and other vendors. It is often referred to as a way to manage “data silos.” It’s similar to the Identity Management use case, as it keeps track of what data you have on who and which database stores it.

d. Network and IT Operations: This is a natural use case because a network topology looks like a graph. So, it makes sense to model it that way.

e. Data Privacy: One cited used case is the ability to comply with GDPR and other privacy requirements, as it lets a company show what data they have on which people.



3. 	NOSQL DATABASE USE CASES
The NoSQL system is a scattered, non-relational database that can be outlined for a huge amount of data storage and can provide high presentation skills over many servers.

Some of the use cases of NOSQL databases are enumerated below;
- Real-time Experience : Nowadays, each contemporary application will need fast and real-time data accessing from the server. However, accessing data in real-time is not simple because the NoSQL databases can provide low dormant real-time experiences. Therefore, a fast organization can process new data, and its operational efficiency is also greater; the general perspective of the real-time experience is to flow the processing of new data for analyzing the historical data.

- Personalization : The mobile and web applications provide the personalization in which it can help to upgrade the conversions, as superior personalization can dictate the huge volumes of data and that can depend on the complete data, the relational database can essential for the high-priced infrastructure in which it can handle and manage a large amount of data which is needful for personalization, at where the NoSQL database can laminate on demand. It can handle a large amount of data flawlessly.

- Data Analytics : The operational and analytical databases can retain as two different environments regularly, and in which the applications can able to utilize the operational databases and the analytics databases cab used by the business intelligence tools for the reporting and analysis, the NoSQL databases which can avail the real-time access at the communicative place. They can support the applications and business intelligence tools at identical times; for example, the mobile and web applications can write and read information from the same NoSQL database. At the same time, any tool can approach the database for huge data analytics.

- Content Management Systems : The content management system depends completely on the database structure, which may require speed and commodity. It has existed for many years, in which it can reserve and read any data and present it to the customer at the interconnection time; hence there is no need to define the data model in advance. The NoSQL-assisted content management system can reserve and control user-created content on the stream.

- Mobile apps with a huge number of users : Not so long ago, mobile phones and tablets can have the top online programs for searching, shopping, and seeing web content; the applications had set out 90% of the mobile data; in a very short period, mobile users have been growing very fast with satisfactory performances, the rigid data model can also support to update the applications than relational data models, and many business organizations are focusing on constructing the web content which are using the NoSQL data stores for their applications.



4. 	HIERARCHICAL DATABASE SYSTEMS
A hierarchical database is DBMS that represent data in a tree-like form. The relationship between records is one-to-many. That means, one parent node can have many child nodes. A hierarchical database model is a data model where data is stored as records but linked in a tree-like structure with the help of a parent and level. Each record has only one parent. The first record of the data model is a root record.
The use cases of hierarchical database are listed below;

- It is very useful and effective when you need to do a tree like hierarchy.

- A good use case of the hierarchical database is a database that can be accessed and updated easily without so much difficulty.

- The hierarchical database has a use case of mainly for storing file systems and geographic information.

- It has an excellent use case in applications where high performance is required such as telecommunications and banking.

- A hierarchical database is also used for Windows Registry in the Microsoft Windows operating system.

- It is useful where the following two conditions are met:
	a. The data should be in a hierarchical pattern i.e. parent-child relationship must be present.
	b. The data in a hierarchical pattern must be accessed through a single path only.




5. 	TIME SERIES DATABASES USE CASES
This are databases such as InfluxDB, Kdb+, and Prometheus, and thy are focused on datasets that change over time.
Some of its use cases are;
- They are designed for dealing with linear data over time, can handle high ingestion rates, and also have built-in features specifically for dealing with time-based data.

- Another use cases for time series databases are managing infrastructure, IoT sensor collection, and log monitoring and alerting.
-


6. 	OBJECT-ORIENTED DATABASES USE CASES
Object database management systems (ODBMSs) are based on objects in object-oriented programing (OOP). In OOP, an entity is represented as an object and objects are stored in memory. Objects have members such as fields, properties, and methods. Objects also have a life cycle that includes the creation of an object, use of an object, and deletion of an object.
Some of the use cases of the OODBMS are listed below..
1. Object databases are commonly used in applications that require high performance and calculations.

2. Object databases are commonly used in applications that requires a very fast result.
3. Some of the common applications that use object databases are real-time systems, architectural & engineering for 3D modeling, telecommunications, and scientific products, molecular science, and astronomy.



7. 	CENTRALIZED DATABASES USE CASES
The centralized database system is a process whereby all data is stored and maintained in on place. The central location is a computer or database.
Some of the use cases of the Centralized Databases are listed below;
- The centralized database mostly used in colleges, banks, hospitals and in small companies.

- In a centralized database system, client/server architecture is used it is the very simplest form of a database system in which one client sent a request to the server.

- The server will receive a request and there will be a response. Many small organizations use a centralized database system because it is less cumbersome.

- Another use case of the centralized database is that the data stored in easilly accessible and also maintained..

- A good use case is that there's efficency and the risk of data tampering is minimal.

- The use of centralized database reduces the cost drastically as compared to other databases. It actually requires less expenses on maintainance.



8. 	PERSONAL DATABASE USE CASE
A personal database is one that is designed for a single person. It is typically stored on a personal computer and has a very simple design, consisting of only a few tables.
Some of the use cases of personal database are listed below;
- The most common use case of the personal databases is web analytics. 

- Another vital use case of the personal database is that it enables the analyzing of data from sensors.

- A use case of personal database is that it is easy to handle and manage and it deals with simple design.

- A good use case is that the loss of data or data tampering is reduced as it imvolves just one computer.
Apache Cassandra and HBase are two of the most commonly used column stores.
