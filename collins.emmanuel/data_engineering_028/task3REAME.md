Categorize the various computing service into different service models..




Cloud Computing can be widely categorized into two different types..

1. Deployment Model.
2. Service Model.


 	DEPLOYMENT MODEL

Cloud deployment model can be classified into 4 diffrent types.

a. Private Cloud: In the private cloud computing model, a proprietary environment is dedicated to your business. Computing and storage resources are extended via virtualized components, which may be on-premise or at the vendor’s data center. A private cloud provides superior levels of security and control to organizations because they can configure and manage the environment based on their specific business needs.


b. Community Cloud: A community cloud model is very similar to a private cloud setup. The only difference is that in a private cloud setup, the cloud computing infrastructure and servers are owned and managed by a single private entity. But in a community cloud model, several different organizations of similar size pool their resources together to share infrastructure costs, maintenance, operations, and deployment. For community model to function properly, the participatory companies should have similar privacy, security and performance requirements.


c. Public Cloud: In a public cloud, computing and storage resources are provided to the customer over the internet. Public cloud offers immense cost benefits because organizations can do away with costly on-site hardware deployment and maintenance.


d. Hybrid Cloud: Hybrid cloud computing offers the best of both public and private worlds by straddling the two with a layer of proprietary software. With a hybrid model, it is possible to host the application in a secure environment while leveraging cost benefits and low time to market offered by the public cloud.



	SERVICE MODEL

1. Infrastructure as a Service: IaaS requires the customer to install traditional applications on servers offered by the cloud platform provider. The customer is expected to manage all aspects of the application software and hardware. The capabilities of the software are identical to the same software deployed using on-premises hardware.


       Characteristics Of IAAS
Below are some of the characteristics of the IAAS service model:

- Virtual machines with pre-installed software.

- Virtual machines with pre-installed operating systems such as windows, linux, and solaris.

- On-demand availability of resources.

- Allows to store copies of particular data at different locations.

- The computing resources can be easily scaled up and down.


   Advantages of IaaS Service Model

1. IaaS Service Model offers time and cost savings since more installation and maintenance of IT software/ hardware happens in-house.


IaaS also offers better flexibility since the on-demand hardware resources can be more easily tailored to your specific needs.


The IaaS model, with its complexity, time, and cost savings, is especially valuable for large enterprises, which have large in-house IT teams that can build and manage the platform by themselves without having to rely on an external partner.

The IaaS offers the desired flexibility to mold the platform according to their specific needs.


    Disadvantages Of IaaS

- Data security issues due to multitenant architecture.

- Vendor outages make customers unable to access their data for a while.

- The need for team training to learn how to manage new infrastructure.




Examples of IaaS

The best known IaaS solutions vendors are Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine(GCE), Amazon Web Services(AWS), Cisco Metapod, DigitalOcean, Linode and Rackspace.


2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)

The hybrid approach of the PaaS allows for the cloud vendor to provide the hardware and the software as a cloud service, and the vendor manages the hardware deployment, software installation, and software configuration. PaaS vendors manage servers, operating system updates, security patches and backups. Clients focus on app development and data without worrying about infrastructure, middleware and OS maintenance.
The major difference between IaaS and PaaS lies in the degree of control given to users.
PaaS is subdivided into 4 types, namely:
- Open Platform as a Service
- Stand-alone development environments
- Application delivery-only environments
- Add-on Development Facilities


	Characteristics of PaaS service model.

- PaaS offers browser based development environment. It allows the developer to create database and edit the application code either via Application Programming Interface or point-and-click tools.

- PaaS provides built-in security, scalability, and web service interfaces.

- PaaS provides built-in tools for defining workflow, approval processes, and business rules.

- It is easy to integrate PaaS with other applications on the same platform.

- PaaS also provides web services interfaces that allow us to connect the applications outside the platform.



    Advantages of PaaS
Advantages of PaaS service model includes some of the following listed below;

- PaaS-built software is highly scalable, available and multi-tenant, as it is cloud-based.

- The development process is quickened and simplified

- Reduced expenses for creating, testing and launching apps

- Automated company policy
- Reduced amount of coding required

- Allows for easy migrating to the hybrid cloud


	Disadvantages of PaaS.
Listed below are some of the disadvantages of PaaS.
- Data security issues

- Compatibility of existing infrastructure (not every element can be cloud-enabled)
- Dependency on vendor’s speed, reliability and support


	Examples of Paas
The best-known PaaS solutions vendors are Google App Engine, Amazon AWS, Windows Azure Cloud Services, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Apache Stratos and OpenShift.



Software as a Service (Saas)
With this offering, users get access to the vendor’s cloud-based software. Users don’t have to download and install SaaS applications on local devices, but sometimes they may need plugins. SaaS software resides on a remote cloud network and can be accessed through the web or APIs. Using such apps, customers can collaborate on projects, as well as store and analyze data.

SaaS is the most common category of cloud computing. The SaaS provider manages everything from hardware stability to app functioning. Clients are not responsible for anything in this model; they only use programs to complete their tasks. In this case, the client software experience is fully dependent on the provider.
Types of SaaS service model includes the following;
a.CRMs

b. ERPs

c. Project Management Solutions

d. Billing Solution

e. Collaboration and Communication Solutions


	Characteristics of SaaS
- The subscription model of utilizing
- No need to download, install or upgrade software
- Resources can be scaled depending on requirements
- Apps are accessible from any connected device
- The provider is responsible for everything


	Advantages of SaaS
Some of the advantages of SaaS includes the following;
- No hardware costs
- No initial setup costs
- Automated upgrades
- Cross-device compatibility
- Accessible from any location
- Pay-as-you-go model
- Scalability
- Easy customization


	Disadvantages of SaaS
Some of the disadvantages of SaaS includes the following;

- Loss of control
- Limited range of solutions
- Connectivity is a must


	Examples of SaaS
The best-known SaaS solutions vendors are Google Apps, Dropbox, Gmail, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx, Concur, GoToMeeting, Office365.



Cloud Computing Identity as a Service(IDaaS)

Identity as a Service (IDaaS) is an  Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution delivered in the form of a cloud-based service hosted and managed by a trusted third party. An IDaaS offering combines all the functions and benefits of an enterprise-class IAM solution with all the economic and operational advantages of a cloud-based service. IDaaS solutions help businesses reduce risk, avoid IT infrastructure cost and complexity, and accelerate digital transformation initiatives. IDaaS is part of the SaaS model.


	Advantages of IDaaS

1. IDaaS’s biggest advantage is how it’s able to consolidate identity management of multiple applications into one streamlined platform.

2. IDaaS frees up the IT admins bny allowing them to automate many functions they would have to do manually with a traditional identity solution.

3. Modern IDaaS lets you tightly control access and centrally increase security through features such as password complexity management, MFA/2FA, SSH keys, and single sign-on (SSO). Identities are the number one attack vector, so choosing a platform with top security features is instrumental in protecting your environment.

4. IDaaS offers freedom of choice. Today’s IT environments are heterogeneous, not homogeneous. Correspondingly, your IDaaS platform should allow your users to choose the applications and products that work best for them, regardless of operating system.


	Disadvantages of IDaaS

1. Single Point of Failure; One of IDaaS greatest benefits – its password management and SSO options – can become its greatest weakness if you experience a breach. Since one credential can give a user access to multiple applications or servers, if the authentication process fails, you’re putting a lot more than a single account at risk.

2. Complex Management Without the Right Platform; One of the greatest benefits to IDaaS is the streamlined admin and user experience. But without the right platform in place, this advantage can very well turn messy and complicated for users and administrators alike.



	Network as a Service(NaaS)

NaaS is defined as network infrastructure hardware, software, services, management, and licensing components consumed in a subscription-based or flexible consumption model. NaaS allows organizations to outsource the provisioning, deployment, network management, maintenance, and lifecycle management of network infrastructure.
Network as a Service (NaaS) is a flexible way to consume enterprise network infrastructure that enables organizations to keep pace with innovation, meet rapidly changing business needs, and optimize network performance and user experiences through a cloud-like subscription model.


	Advantages of NaaS

1. Cost Savings; Implementing Network as a Service can significantly reduce many IT costs – including infrastructure, hardware, and software costs, as well as operational, maintenance, and service costs.

2. Proactive Maintenance and Issue Prevention; Because managed service providers have the infrastructure in place to support quick implementations and upgrades, as well as ongoing proactive and preventative maintenance, Network as a Service provides access to benefits that companies might not otherwise be able to afford.

3. Enhanced Security ; With Network as a Service, most providers can ensure the security of the entire voice and data network so that all transactions, business-critical applications, and data are kept safe and secure.

4. Most Network as a Service providers can guarantee levels of uptime in the five-nines (99.999%) range. Many Service Level Agreements (SLAs) made with managed network service providers guarantee levels of availability, network uptime, and response and resolution times for addressing network issues.

5. Improved Quality of Service (QoS); Companies can also benefit from better voice quality, more efficient call routing, and improved network management with built-in the Quality of Service (QoS) that comes with Network as a Service offerings.  High quality, high speed MPLS backbone can be provided across a variety of internet connections, and QoS is ensured by prioritizing traffic.


	Disadvantages of NaaS

1. Visibility and control over security and compliance issues can be a challenge to NaaS deployment.

2. A major disadvantage to NaaS is that there needs to be a network source of truth in place before networks can be instantiated or activated quickly.
