What is User Experience ?
User experience" encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products.

The first requirement for an exemplary user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother. Next comes simplicity and elegance that produce products that are a joy to own, a joy to use. True user experience goes far beyond giving customers what they say they want, or providing checklist features. In order to achieve high-quality user experience in a company's offerings there must be a seamless merging of the services of multiple disciplines, including engineering, marketing, graphical and industrial design, and interface design.

What is User Experince Design ?
User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. UX design involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

Designing an experience includes not only making the software easy to use but also designing the other experiences related to the product, for example, the marketing campaign, the packaging and after-sales support. Most importantly, UX design is concerned with delivering solutions that address pain points and needs. After all, no one will use a product that serves no purpose.

Where does UX design come from?
The term “UX” was first coined in the 1990s by Dr. Donald Norman, an electrical engineer and cognitive scientist at Apple. A pioneer of user-centered design, Norman emphasized the importance of designing based on the needs and goals of the end user. In doing so, he introduced the term “user experience”, which, in Norman’s own words, is meant to encompass “all aspects of a person’s experience with a system, from the materials used to the interaction itself (physical or digital), along with the interface, graphics, and orientation.”


Fundamentals of UI/UX Design

The five main principles of UX design
There are many important principles within UX design but to simplify things a bit, we’ve broken them down into five main concepts: Empathy, strategy, usability, inclusivity, and validation.

Empathy
Quality UX design puts users’ needs at the forefront of product development. To understand the user and what obstacles they face, UX designers must practice empathic design. With empathy, designers are able to put themselves in the user’s shoes and learn about their daily life, what problems they need solved, what expectations they have when interacting with certain products, and what a good experience looks like to them.

Strategy
Designing effective solutions to difficult problems can be a complex process. Therefore, a crucial part of UX design is having a well-defined plan and set of goals before starting any project. Many designers will craft a UX strategy that outlines a variety of UX objectives including chosen research methods, preferred design and testing systems, and what success looks like for both the user and the business. While an important guideline to follow, a UX strategy is not unchangeable and may be amended as designers move through the design process.

Usability
In a world of rapidly advancing and sometimes confusing technology, consumers often lean towards products that take little brain power to operate. The last thing a user wants is to feel like ordering food delivery on their phone is equivalent to completing a 1000 piece puzzle. A big part of UX design is making products and services that are simple and intuitive to use for people of all ages and abilities. To do this, designers take into account things like behavioral psychology, accessibility, affordances, and mental models when designing for optimal and effortless usability.

Inclusivity
A common phrase you may hear in the UX industry is “design for all”—meaning that our design efforts should take into account the needs of people of all races, ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and more. UX designers have the ability to shape the world around them through their designs and the power to solve complex problems that affect a wide range of individuals.

Exemplary UX design incorporates the experience and needs of under-represented or oppressed groups of people and can even find solutions for their unique problems.

Inclusive design ensures a variety of voices are being heard when designing for diverse populations.

Validation
However impressive a design may seem, it would mean nothing if not validated by user testing. One of the most crucial aspects of UX design is to test proposed solutions with the people who will actually be using them in real life. User feedback guides and informs the design process and helps ensure that the products being made are ones people will happily want to use. Even after products are released, designers are constantly using methods to assess their success and where improvements can be made.
