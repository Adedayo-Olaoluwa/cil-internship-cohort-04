**The various computing service are as follows:**
## 1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
## 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
## 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

## IAAS (Infrastructure as a service). 
<p>
IaaS is also known as Hardware as a Service (HaaS). It is a computing infrastructure managed over the internet. The main advantage of using IaaS is that it helps users to avoid the high cost and complexity of purchasing and managing the physical servers. There is a shared responsibility between the service providers and users.</p>

It works very similarly to the traditional computer hardware (via operating systems, networks, servers, etc.), the only difference is that it operates virtually.

IaaS forms one of the three fundamental models of cloud service network OS. Whenever a user purchases software, server, cloud space, network equipment, and more, the IaaS provider rents those resources in the form of fully outsourced service (as a demand model). IaaS supports dynamic scaling and distributes its resources as a service. It thus, generally, allows multiple users on one piece of hardware.

There are various types of IaaS offered by different cloud computing providers like GCP, AZURE, AWS, ORACLE etc.

Example of these services include: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce Cloud, OpenShift, S3, EC2, Lambda by AWS, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Virtual Private Cloud all By Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Azure VM and
Azure disk storage offered by Microsoft Azure.

## Characteristics of IaaS
- Resources are available as a service
- Services are highly scalable
- Dynamic and flexible
- GUI and API-based access
- Automated administrative tasks

## PaaS (Platform as a service)

PAAS, an acronym for Platform As A Service, is a cloud delivery service model for various applications. SaaS provides its users with an elastic scaling of their apps. In this way, the developers can build various services and applications over the internet itself. These services can be private, public, or even hybrid.

Companies and developers can use the framework (that PaaS provides) to easily and quickly customize (and build) apps. Hence, the developers can instead focus on the application software while still not being bothered about managing various infrastructure matters (like software updates, operating systems, etc.). So, the IT managers only need to manage the software/application and remove the rest of the clutter.

Examples of PaaS offered by different cloud providers include AWS
Cloud9, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeDeploy, Google App Engine, Cloud Dataflow, Azure CDN, App Services, Apple Developer Xcode etc.

# Saas (Software as a Service)
SAAS is an acronym for Service As A Software. It is the most prevalent of all the cloud services -allowing its users to run existing online apps.

All the services ranging from application, data, runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualisation, servers, storage and networking are managed and scaled by the service providers following the instructions of the client during provisioning.

SaaS provides various software like word processing, email, design software, analytics, collaboration software, and other application hosts. SaaS applications can be directly accessed through web browsers- eliminating the need to install any application on a user's workstation.

A SaaS vendor manages operating systems, servers, data, applications, storage, and many more. Thus, an enterprise or user only needs to worry about software usage and employee access to it. SaaS works as a model software- deployed in the form of hosting service that anyone can access (in the form of Output Re-written / Rephrased Text) via the internet or by using a software delivery model.

The SaaS hosts its clientsâ€™ software and the associated data centrally. So, the clients can access them using an online browser via the web. The SaaS services assist in the deployment and development of modern apps.

Examples of SaaS services include Google G-Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce,  Dropbox, Cisco WebEx, Concur, GoToMeeting, github etc.
