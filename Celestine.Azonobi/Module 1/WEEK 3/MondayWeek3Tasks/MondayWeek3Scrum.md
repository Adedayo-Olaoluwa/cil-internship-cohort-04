# 1. Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of its benefits in software development.

Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal. It predefines a step-by-step component that a team will obey to create a ready-for-market product. <br>
When it comes to software development, a scrum can be deployed  by developers where they'll put their heads together collaborating to solve complex problems. 

- The Product owner provides a backlog/build-up which contains a list of items. <br/>
- Scrum team takes the top item from the backlog as a task and collaborate in meetings at regular intervals in order to complete the task within a specified timeframe.
- A core member also known as Scrum master (part of the team) keeps the team focused on the goal.
- Each task ends with a task review and the team chooses another item from the backlog as a task.
- This routine is continued until the project is completed and delivered within its deadline.

# Benefits
- Developers who want the freedom to make decisions thrive in scrum teams.
- Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.
- Each sprint produces a product that is ready for market even though the project is ongoing. The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be made available on the market.
- Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.
