# UX DESIGN: WHAT I HAVE FOUND.

<pre> As we become more reliant on software and machines in our every day lives, accessibility and usability have become very necessary. This is where I found that UX design comes into play and that has shaped the misconception I had on the term.</pre>

# What does UX mean?
Well, according to Career foundry, User experience, or UX, is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context. 
Depending on how the product or service is designed, the experience can range from delightful to downright frustrating! <br>

# What does UXD mean?
User experience design, or UXD, considers each and every element that shapes the user experience. It’s all about designing specifically for the needs of the user or customer, looking at things like ease of use, quality, and efficiency.

### USER INTERFACE:
UI is the acronym for user interface. Unlike UX, I found out that UI is only concerned with the digital part of a product such as its look, feel, presentation and interactivity.

## Steps to carrying out a UX Design
While learning I also found out that the UX design process is generally divided into four key phases: research, design, testing, and implementation.
<p>Based on these phases, UX designers tend to follow a certain sequence for each project: carrying out user research, analyzing their findings, defining user personas, mapping out user flows, creating wireframes and prototypes, conducting user testing, and finally, handing the designs over for visual design and development.</p>

**Research** refers to finding ways to understand how user feel about the product. It involves initial competitor research to see what’s out there, before moving on to interviews with actual prospective users. It could be through surveys or interviews to exiting users. It helps to identify their needs, pain-points, and any opportunities for improvement.

**User personas** means that you need to understand what your users need, how they think, and how they behave. It’s therefore really important to engage with your users directly, view from their perspective and figure out how they feel while using a product.

**Wireframes and Prototypes**:  A wireframe is like a blueprint, demonstrating the layout of the design and how it will function after production. A prototype is essentially a scaled-down version of the final product—a sample version which allows you to test your ideas and designs before you get them developed.

**Testing**: It’s important to test your designs on real users as this helps you get authentic feedback from those who will actually be using the product. The most common type of testing for UX designers is usability testing, which is a technique used to evaluate how intuitive and user-friendly a particular design is.

After several rounds of testing, the product is handed over to the designer (UI) who handles the aesthetics which is based on the UX designer’s wireframes and prototypes.
UI designers also have a solid understanding of the user’s needs and goals, but their speciality lies in the user’s visual experience.

# The Different Areas Of UX Design
A great way to look at the specializations of UX design is through the eye of the quadrant model, which groups the field into four main disciplines:

## 1. Experience Strategy (ExS)
Experience strategy is all about devising a holistic business strategy, incorporating both the customer’s needs and those of the company.

## 2. User Research (UR)
UX researchers focus on the research aspect of design. They conduct both qualitative and quantitative research, gathering in-depth insights into the target users.

## 3. Information Architecture (IA)

<pre>Information architecture has roots in both Cognitive Psychology and Library Information Science (LIS). You can think of Information Architects as user-centric digital librarians! As an information architect, you may be responsible for assessing the IA of an existing product, planning the IA of a new product from scratch, labelling information, and creating wireframes and taxonomies. </pre>

## 4. Interaction Design (IxD)
<pre>Interaction designers answer questions like: “What happens when a user clicks a button?” or “How will the user transition between different pages on a mobile app?” Ultimately, they look at how to reduce friction between the product and the user.

Some other specialist parts for a UX designer include;
UX writer, Voice designer, UX developer and UX/UI designer.</pre>

# Skils needed to become a UX designer.
Just like most tech tracks, a blend of soft and hard (technical) skils are a real necessity to have. As a UX designer, you’ll often work on cross-team and cross-functional products; this is where soft skills can make the most impact.

**Soft skills** include communication, empathy and organization.
The **hard skills** include user research, information architecture and wireframing and prototyping.
