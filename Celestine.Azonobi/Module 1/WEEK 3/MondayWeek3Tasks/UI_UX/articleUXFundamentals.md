# User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) Design Fundamentals
# An introduction
<pre>The foundation for developing a user-friendly and accessible product in online and app development is UI and UX design. UI and UX design are necessary for all electronic devices, including computers, household appliances, and other mobile and web-based applications.

You may already be familiar with the phrases UX and UI if you work in technology or the digital sector. You may have even overheard the terms casually while strolling through the streets of the world's tech hubs. They are frequently used interchangeably or in tandem, but as we'll see, they are actually two quite different concepts. However, each is essential to the other's success.

According to special studies and evidence, UX/UI design is a high-demand field that requires the set of knowledge and skills which are applicable not only to pure ITjobs, but to a wide variety of careers,from marketing to web design to human-computer interaction.It is also pointed out that UX/UI design is a domain which is the intersection of such fields as pure design, engineering, marketing library science and psychology.

The great thing about UX design is that there are no specific prerequisites. People have been seen to come from all walks of life and professional backgrounds that have become successful UX designers. You don’t even need to have any professional UX experience to start working on your portfolio!

# What is UX and UI?
## UX
User Experience, or UX, stands for "User Experience," and as the name implies, UX design takes into account how the end-user interacts with the business, service, or products. According to Career foundry, User experience, or UX, is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context. 
Depending on how the product or service is designed, the experience can range from delightful to downright frustrating!. 

It's important to note that this method may be used on practically anything, from websites to street lamps. It is a non-digital method that, in theory, concentrates on how a product or service feels all around.

UX is frequently employed in the digital industries since it involves how the user interacts with the service. The more general phrase for taking into account all the many components of this experience is "UX design." The primary factors taken into account are the user's experience with the product and how simple it is for them to use the good or service.

## UI

User Interface, or UI which is an acronym in contrast to UX, is solely a digital phrase that refers to how a product or service appears, feels, is presented, and interacts with users. It's the point at which a user interacts with a digital product, such as the touchscreen on a phone or the screen on a food app where you can select the type of food you want or a bank app where you can carry out transactions.

UI refers to the process of making a product's user interface to be seamlessly feasible and accessible to the users. This requires taking into account every visual or interactive element the user may see. A UI designer's major goal is to make the user's interaction with the digital product as dynamic and appealing as possible, whether through typography, color schemes, or responsive design.

# What is the difference between UX and UI?

To understand the distinctions between UX and UI, it helps to think of the product as the human body. The code that gives the product (or body) structure is encoded in the bones. UX embodies the organs that support all the various functions. Additionally, UI symbolizes the physical appearance of the body as well as its senses and reactions.

Despite their professional relationship, the elements themselves are quite different. They both relate to very different aspects of the development process and the design discipline. They also work closely together, both being really crucial to the creation and success of a product.

# How does UX and UI work together?
<pre>
You’ll often find that hiring managers and big tech companies use these terms interchangeably, without necessarily understanding or demonstrating what each one truly entails. While they work together, with UI effectively translating the UX design scheme into an easily digestible and interactive format, they also work separately.
This is so that businesses can more frequently mix the two into a well-rounded solution.

So how do they complement one another?  

The truth is that they are both equally vital, if you're asking which is more significant. Everyone wants something that looks fantastic and is incredibly usable, from developers to users. This is a manifest for UI and UX. Although there are situations in which one is appropriate but not the other, combining both yields the best outcomes.</pre>

## Steps to carrying out a UX Design

While learning I also found out that the UX design process is generally divided into four key phases: research, design, testing, and implementation.
<p>Based on these phases, UX designers tend to follow a certain sequence for each project: carrying out user research, analyzing their findings, defining user personas, mapping out user flows, creating wireframes and prototypes, conducting user testing, and finally, handing the designs over for visual design and development.</p>

**Research** refers to finding ways to understand how user feel about the product. It involves initial competitor research to see what’s out there, before moving on to interviews with actual prospective users. It could be through surveys or interviews to exiting users. It helps to identify their needs, pain-points, and any opportunities for improvement.

**User personas** means that you need to understand what your users need, how they think, and how they behave. It’s therefore really important to engage with your users directly, view from their perspective and figure out how they feel while using a product.

**Wireframes and Prototypes**:  A wireframe is like a blueprint, demonstrating the layout of the design and how it will function after production. A prototype is essentially a scaled-down version of the final product—a sample version which allows you to test your ideas and designs before you get them developed.

**Testing**: It’s important to test your designs on real users as this helps you get authentic feedback from those who will actually be using the product. The most common type of testing for UX designers is usability testing, which is a technique used to evaluate how intuitive and user-friendly a particular design is.

After several rounds of testing, the product is handed over to the designer (UI) who handles the aesthetics which is based on the UX designer’s wireframes and prototypes.
UI designers also have a solid understanding of the user’s needs and goals, but their speciality lies in the user’s visual experience.


# The Different Areas Of UX Design
A great way to look at the specializations of UX design is through the eye of the quadrant model, which groups the field into four main disciplines:

## 1. Experience Strategy (ExS)
Experience strategy is all about devising a holistic business strategy, incorporating both the customer’s needs and those of the company.

## 2. User Research (UR)
UX researchers focus on the research aspect of design. They conduct both qualitative and quantitative research, gathering in-depth insights into the target users.

## 3. Information Architecture (IA)

<pre>Information architecture has roots in both Cognitive Psychology and Library Information Science (LIS). You can think of Information Architects as user-centric digital librarians! As an information architect, you may be responsible for assessing the IA of an existing product, planning the IA of a new product from scratch, labelling information, and creating wireframes and taxonomies. </pre>

## 4. Interaction Design (IxD)
<pre>Interaction designers answer questions like: “What happens when a user clicks a button?” or “How will the user transition between different pages on a mobile app?” Ultimately, they look at how to reduce friction between the product and the user.

Some other specialist parts for a UX designer include;
UX writer, Voice designer, UX developer and UX/UI designer.</pre>

# Skils needed to become a UX/UI designer.
Just like most tech tracks, a blend of soft and hard (technical) skils are a real necessity to have. As a UX designer, you’ll often work on cross-team and cross-functional products; this is where soft skills can make the most impact.

**Soft skills** include communication, empathy, adaptability, emotional intelligence and organizational skills. <br>
The **hard skills** include user research, information architecture and wireframing and prototyping.
There are also other hard skills that it is useful to have some knowledge of. An understanding of some programming languages will put you in good stead to start on your journey in UX and UI. Similarly, knowing the basics of HTML and CSS and having some coding knowledge will make you stand out from the crowd too.

# How do you learn UX and UI design?
<p>
The Internet is full of great resources on UX design principles and practices—everything from what employers are looking for to how to get started on your portfolio.

### Self-study
Self-study with a more systematic approach led by someone with experience in the field is a great way to start if you're dedicated and disciplined.

### Non-Mentored Online Courses
There are also quite a few non-mentored online courses in UX design. These provide a more synchronous basis than self-study and are often self-paced and low-cost—if not free of charge.


### Structured Programs
For structured programs, you can find three types: in-person, blended, and online. In-person programs operate much like a regular school, where you’re required to attend in-person. Blended programs are more flexible. Typically, half of the instruction will be online with the other half in-person. Lastly, online programs are 100% online, with no in-person attendance required.

# Conclusion
The modern age depends heavily on UX and UI, thus many companies will be searching for applicants that have some background in one or both of these design fields. Technology takes center stage as we experience the fourth Industrial Revolution, and businesses will strive to provide people with clean and seamless digital experiences.

They both require quite distinct skill sets, yet they complement one another well because each is essential to the success of the other. Just as a perfectly acceptable user experience can be ruined by poor visual interface design, a wonderfully designed website cannot compensate for a confused interface. However, amazing things can happen when everything comes together in sync.
