#### Model 2


There are three main Service Models 

	1. Infrastructure as a Service
	• Compute
	• Storage storage resiliency
	• Network
	• Load balancers
	• Security
	• clustering
	• log access

	2. Platform as a Service
	• Infrastructure
	• Application design, testing and development tools.
	• Middleware
	• OSes
	• Databases
	• Monitoring and management tools

	3. Software as a Service
	In the software-on-demand SaaS model, the provider gives customers network-based access to a single copy of an application that the provider
	created specifically for SaaS distribution. The application's source code is the same for all customers, 
 	and when new features or functionalities are released, they are rolled out to all customers. 
 	Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA), the customer's data for each model may be stored locally, in the cloud or both locally 
 	and in the cloud.
