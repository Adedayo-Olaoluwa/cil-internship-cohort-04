### SCRUM
Scrum, one of the most popular Agile methods of software developer, is a flexible process of development that involves the customer in the product development process,  lists out the product development into small task called back log, takes the product development one item from the list, one steps at a time (sprint) with consistent tests for each item in each step (sprint backlog). In this process, on every completed sprint backlog (sprint), progress is analyzed in meets called Daily Scrum, where targets are updated. When the product is ready for show/delivery or at the end of a sprint, a review for that sprint is done (sprint review), before another beings.  This process is repeated continuously for each backlog throughout the product/software development life cycle, until deadline is met or project budget is spent.

Scrum involves the product owner and the scrum team (ie. scrum master, and scrum members).
