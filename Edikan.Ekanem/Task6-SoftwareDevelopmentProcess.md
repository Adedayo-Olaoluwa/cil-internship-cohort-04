# CIL Module 1-Group 6 Monday task

> ## **TASK 1:**

Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's benefits in software development.

> ## **ANSWER:**

## **Definition of Scrum**

Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. It is a widely used subset of **Agile Software Development**.

The word scrum is also used in rugby to define a play where players struggle against eachother to gain possession of the ball. The goal of a scrum in software development is **to perform at a high-performing level** like a rugby team does in a scrum.

## **How Scrum Works**

In a rugby scrum, all the players put their heads together.

When it comes to software development, a scrum can be characterized by **developers putting their heads together to address complex problems.**

- Scrum software development starts with a wish list of features — a.k.a. **A PRODUCT BACKLOG**. The team meets to discuss:
  - The backlog.
  - What still needs to be completed.
  - How long it will take.
- Scrum relies on an agile software development concept called **SPRINTS**:
  - Sprints are periods when software development is done.
  - A sprint usually lasts from one week to one month to complete an item from the backlog.
  - The goal of each sprint is to create a saleable product.
  - Each sprint ends with a sprint review.
  - Then the team chooses another piece of backlog to develop — which will start a new sprint.
  - Sprints continue until the project deadline or the project budget is spent.
- In daily scrums, teams meet to discuss their progress since the previous meeting and make plans for that day.
  - The meetings should be brief — no longer than 15 minutes.
  - Each team member needs to be present and prepared.
  - The ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on the goal.


## **Benefits of Scrum**

Rugby players try to gain control of the ball in the scrum and move it downfield.

Software developers use scrum to move their projects quickly. And the benefits trickle down to software developers:

- Developers who want the freedom to make decisions thrive in scrum teams. Team morale tends to be high.
- Each sprint produces a product that is ready for the market even though the project is ongoing. The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be on the market.
- The incremental process shortens the time to market by about 30 percent to 40 percent. Because the product owner is part of the scrum team, requirements can be delivered as they are needed.
- Scrum projects often realize a higher *return on investment* (ROI). This is attributed to:
  - Decreased time to market.
  - Early and regular feedback that prompts course corrections early when they are less costly.
  - Defects that are fewer and less costly.
  - Projects fail early and quickly when it’s less costly.
- Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.
- Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.
