## **Answers for UX Design Blogpost :**

1. Your mission for today is to start browsing websites and apps you use frequently and to make a note of anything that you find intuitive or frustrating. 
    - [Ibom Air](https://www.ibomair.com/) : Has a very intuitive website.
   - [Jumia](https://www.jumia.com.ng/) : Unexpected content shifts.

2. For today’s task, we want to turn the focus back to you. Think about the UX design process — do any of the functions or tasks that we discussed resemble anything you do in your current job? If so, write down what they are and how they’re similar to the UX design process.
   - **Research:** Every process or task starts with proper research.
   - **Affinity Mapping:** After research, I analyze my findings and turn them into meaningful insights.

3. Your mission today is to identify some key UX influencers and try to categorize them into one or two of the quadrants. Where do their strengths and interests appear to lie? Do they match a particular job title?
   - [JEFF GOTHELF](https://jeffgothelf.com/) : UX Developer - Experience Strategy
   - [Yael Levey](https://www.iamnotmypixels.com/about-yael-levey/) : Product Design Manager - Interaction Design
   - [Jared Spool](https://twitter.com/jmspool) : Interaction Design
  
4. Let’s imagine you’re a newly qualified UX designer and have just started your first job in the field. Someone asks you what you do, but when you say “UX design”, they look rather confused. How would you explain to them what UX design is and what your role entails? Think about the following:
What is UX design?, What does a UX designer actually do?, How is UX design different to other design fields?
    - As a UX designer, I make a product or service usable, enjoyable, and accessible. I am responsible for a users overall satisfaction with a product.
  
5. For today’s tutorial, we’re sending you on a mission for inspiration! Browse the internet and find two or three portfolios that catch your eye. For each portfolio, identify three things that you think the designer does well, and why. At the same time, look out for some aspects that could be improved. Pay attention to the “About me” sections, the overall usability of each portfolio, and most importantly, how they present their case studies. Do they document their process thoroughly? How do they demonstrate their approach to problem solving? How could they present a stronger narrative?
