#Describe what you understand by scrum and elaborate on some of it's benefit in software development.

#Defintation of scrum
Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. It is a widely used subset of agile software development.

#Who is a scrum

There are three roles that defined the scrum framework which market

1. The scrum team does the work. It is the individuals who are working together in the sprints to produce the products.
2. The scrum master is part of the scrum team makes sure the team works in compliance with the scrum rules. This is not a manager.
3. The product owner represents the customer. This role prioritizes the backlog and coordinates the scrum teamwork. The product owner is a role similar to project manager in more traditional project management frameworks.

#Benefit of scrum in software development
1. Better Product Quality : You will have better product quality if you’re checking in with your customers and stakeholders for evolving requirements during sprint reviews because they will be able to determine more quickly whether the software matches their needs.  When it’s not meeting their needs, you have the chance to pivot and change directions much earlier and much faster than in a waterfall project.

2. More Control and Reduced Risk : Projects are more controlled because they are time-boxed and everyone knows what task they have to do.  When used properly, Scrum allows everyone in the project from customer to stakeholder, from developer to Scrum Master to know what they are doing and when it should be done.  Teams communicate and collaborate daily so there are less unknowns or crises that pop up out of nowhere.  Because you are working together more effectively through collaboration in Scrum, and are more focused, you will see reduced risk to the project.

3. Improved Customer Satisfaction : Business Value are Customer Satisfaction are two big wins with Scrum.  This is due to the fact that you have the potential for delivering real value in as quickly as two weeks! Starting at end of the very first Sprint, the customer is interacting with the product and giving feedback. This continues through the life of the project. Features and enhancements are driven much more by customers in Scrum which ultimately leads to a better product. Better products = happier customers. Another win stemming from regular customer engagement in the process is that customers feel deeply involved with the product - and even champion it - because they are helping to build it.  This makes Scrum development a winner for both improved business value and customer satisfaction.

4. Faster ROI : Faster ROI comes from delivering quality products that the customers can use in a shorter time frame.  Take TurboTax, rather than focus on software for all states and federal income at once, like a waterfall project might do, they break it down. Scrum would have them focus fist on the federal income tax return that everyone needs and then later on a key state or a small group of states. Every Sprint allows you to review and pivot depending on the feedback from customers and stakeholders.



#From the Agile manifesto

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

2. Working software over comprehensive documentation

3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

4. Responding to change over following a plan
