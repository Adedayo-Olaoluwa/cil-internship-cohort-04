#Fundamentals of UX & UI

User experience (UX) refers to the user’s journey when interacting with a product or service. UX design is the process of creating products or services that provide meaningful experiences for users, involving many different areas of product development including branding, usability, function, and design.

UI design, on the other hand, refers to the actual interfaces with which users engage. The UI design process may include buttons or widgets, text, images, sliders, and other interactive elements. UI designers ensure that every visual element, transition, and animation included within a product or service is setting the stage for a fluid, positive experience.


#Key Differences Between UX and UI Design

Look vs. Feel
UX and UI design play related, but different roles in a product’s development. UI design involves the look of a product — namely, the visual components and interactive elements that contribute to a strong user experience. Meanwhile, UX design focuses on the overarching feel of the product or service and the components that will lead to a meaningful, relevant experience for users.

Design vs. Prototyping
UX and UI designers might work on the same product, but they have different duties and goals. UX designers often create wireframes and testable prototypes that form the basis of a website or service’s user flow, while UI designers finalize products and designs that drive user engagement.

#What Does a UX Designer Do?

Content Strategy
Content strategy focuses on the planning, creation, and execution of content which can include text, images, and multimedia elements on a page or in an application. Content strategy isn’t always the responsibility of a UX designer, but more companies are emphasizing content-driven design to deliver a more effective experience.
      Tasks involved with UX content strategy include:

1. Customer analysis
2. Content auditing and mapping

Testing and Prototyping
Testing and prototyping are important parts of the UX design process. Most designs go through multiple iterations before they are finalized, and these changes are backed up along the way. Knowledge of common research methodologies (such as A/B testing) is also an asset to UX design.
      Tasks involved with testing and prototyping include:

1. A/B testing between button placements, text layouts, or other design elements
2. Wireframing the basic structure of designs
3. Prototyping designs to test for function


Consumer Research
The best UX designs are driven by research, which informs UX designers about their problems and what can be solved by a specific design. UX research can involve questionnaires, surveys, focus groups, product testing, or other research methodologies. The specific research methodologies depend on what a company wants to know about a product or its users.
        Common consumer research tasks include:

1. Designing research instruments
2. Conducting focus groups
3. Analyzing data from questionnaires and surveys

#What Does a UI Designer Do?

Creating and Maintaining Brand Style
Establishing a defined visual brand style is crucial for most modern businesses and, from a usability standpoint, this is a primary component in the UI design process. UI designers are often tasked with creating products or entities that are aesthetically consistent with an overarching brand.
      Tasks involved with maintaining brand style include:

1. Creating brand style guides
2. Maintaining accessible design standards
3. Implementing a brand’s style consistently across a product or service


Visual Design
UI designers build and optimize the individual elements of a digital entity, including typography, color, button design, and other fields contributing to a strong interface.
     Tasks involved with building visual design include:

1. Designing buttons and other clickable elements
2. Coloring sections and elements of a website or service
3. Choosing appropriate fonts and typesetting


Responsive Design
Modern products and services need to be accessible across a wide variety of devices, including laptops, desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Responsive design refers to the process of creating content that can be viewed on as many types of devices as possible. This is especially important for web design — sites should be viewable and usable on everything from a 27-inch monitor to a 5-inch smartphone screen.
     Examples of responsive design tasks include:

1. Developing flexible website or program layouts
2. Creating easily resizable vector elements
3. Managing responsive design style guides
