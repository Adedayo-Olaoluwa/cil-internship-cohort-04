# Scrum

## Defination

Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. It is a widely used subset of agile software development.

## How Scrum Works
In a rugby scrum, all the players literally put their heads together. When it comes to software development, a scrum can be characterized by developers putting their heads together to address complex problems.
* Scrum software development starts with a wish list of features — a.k.a. a product backlog. The team meets to discuss:
*   The backlog.
*	What still needs to be completed.
*	How long it will take.
*	Scrum relies on an agile software development concept called sprints:
*	Sprints are periods of time when software development is actually done.
*	A sprint usually lasts from one week to one month to complete an item from the backlog.
*	The goal of each sprint is to create a saleable product.
*	Each sprint ends with a sprint review.
*	Then the team chooses another piece of backlog to develop — which starts a new sprint.
*	Sprints continue until the project deadline or the project budget is spent.
*	In daily scrums, teams meet to discuss their progress since the previous meeting and    make plans for that day.
*	The meetings should be brief — no longer than 15 minutes.
*	Each team member needs to be present and prepared.
*	The Scrum Master keeps the team focused on the goal.

## Who is in the Scrum?

In software development, three roles are defined in the scrum framework:

*	The **scrum team** does the work. It is the individuals who are working together in the sprints to produce the products.
*	The **scrum master** is part of the scrum team makes sure the team works in compliance with the scrum rules. This is not a manager.
*	The **product owner** represents the customer. This role prioritizes the backlog and coordinates the scrum teamwork. The product owner is a role similar to project manager in more traditional project management frameworks.

# Scrum Benefits

It's not always easy to organize development efforts around the Scrum framework, but a team that adheres to the key principles and operates effectively should expect to achieve numerous benefits.

To realize Scrum's benefits, Scrum team members should perform each Scrum team role properly and ensure that their teams have an efficient structure.

When a team's Scrum structure is weak, it likely will fail to properly create or prioritize a backlog, and stakeholders will be more inclined to change the sprint backlog within a sprint. These missteps will result in poor increment success, less stability in the product increment and a disjointed team.

Here are 10 Scrum benefits that make the framework worthwhile and some tips on how to achieve each benefit.

- **Clearly defined sprint goals:** Each sprint produces a product that is ready for market even though the project is ongoing. The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be on the market.
- **Flexibility to allow quick product changes:** Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals. 
- **Tested, stable products:** Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.
- **Productive Scrum meetings:** Sprint planning, Daily standup, sprint review and sprint retrospect improve development productivity.
- **Timely Scrum feedback loops:** Feedback is critical to product success and delivery. Developers provide daily feedback to the team on any complications or blockers they have encountered. At a retrospective, the overall team will share successes along with lessons learned to modify and improve the process moving into the next sprint. 
- **On-time delivery:** The incremental process shortens the time to market by about 30 percent to 40 percent. Because the product owner is part of the scrum team, requirements can be delivered as they are needed.
- **Team cohesiveness:** People naturally prefer to work on teams that communicate effectively, solve problems and meet deadlines. Scrum is designed to achieve this with minimum overhead.
- **Developer growth:** Developers who want the freedom to make decisions thrive in scrum teams. Team morale tends to be high.
- **Reduced risk:** Projects failing early and quickly when it’s less costly.
- **Higher ROI:** Successful Scrum practices help the business realize rapid delivery with an adaptable delivery team that minimizes wasted effort.


# Agile Manifesto
*   Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
*	Working software over comprehensive documentation.
*	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
*	Responding to change over following a plan.
