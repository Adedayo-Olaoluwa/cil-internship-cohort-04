# **Understanding UX/UI Design fundamentals**

# **Introduction** 
Imagine walking through a store without proper shelf label searching for items, after hours of searching you couldn't find anyone or anything to point you to the direction of those items on your grossry list, how will you feel? frusrated, definately YES. Again, imagine walking through another store with proper shelf label and personel who are always there to assist, how will you feel? elated, definately YES. which of the above stores will you frequent more? definately the second one. The store interface and the experience of the customer is what developers refers to as User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design. 

# **What is UI/UX Design**
**UI Design** is the human-first approch to designing of the aesthetic visual touchpoints that allows users to interact with a digital products. It's the combinations of topography, color palettes, buttons, animations, and imagery to the delight of digital product users.

**UX Design** is the full experience that delight users with their effectiveness from a user's first contact to the last of either physical or digital products. It's a structural design solutions for pain points that users encounter anywhere along their journey with the product. 

# **What are UX/UI fundamentals**
## **What is the process of UX?**
UX has 3 key phases: discovery, ideation, and validation. However, UX design is cyclical and you will often need to repeat certain steps and even the entire process multiple
times. The final outcome will be a set of low-resolution wireframes (a draft of the function and structure of a product).
### **Discover**
UX always starts with discovery—interviewing potential customers to understand what the target audience needs and talking to stakeholders to understand their goals and competitive analysis. Discovery is all about WHY - xxx. During discovery you will validate your problem (your product is there to solve that problem), identify your end users, and determine project goals.

**Methods:**
- User Research (Interviews, Ethnography)
- Empathy Mapping
- Task Analysis
- Stakeholder Mapping
- Service Blueprints
- Analytics and Heuristics
- Competitive Analysis

**Outcome:** Problem Validation, User Personas, Project Goals
### **Ideate**
Next comes ideation—using a variety of tools to imagine a solution that solves the user problem, while aligning with the company goals within technological possibility. Ideation is the process of finding out HOW. How will you create a solution that solves the users deepest needs in a delightful manner? Designers will implement a variety of tools to figure out how to solve the user problems. This process is very much like a funnel, where the solution is very wide at the beginning, and the goal of the process is to quickly, envision and test products with target customers in order to pivot and define. During ideation you will organize your discovery, explore options, and develop wireframes and prototypes.

**Methods:**
- Sketching
- Wireframes
- Information Architecture
- Journey Mapping / Page Flows
- User Journey Writing
- Paper Prototypes
- Interaction Design

**Outcome:** Solution Exploration

### **Validate (Test, Prototype)**
The UX process ends with validation—the testing of wireframes and prototypes to iterate on the interface until it’s intuitive and delightful. Validation is when we finally know WHAT we’re building. During this phase, designers will create wireframes or prototypes, and test them with users during a process called usability testing to evaluate how an actual user will react to the product. The designer observes, asks open-ended questions and iterates on the wireframes based on this feedback. Validation testing is giving those wireframes or prototypes to real users. You’re tracking actual interaction with the prototype here as well
as confirming previously held assumptions. The results of validation testing should be changes in flow and
layout, though likely not scope anymore. During validation you will validate your ideas, learn, and plan for
the next iteration. 

**Methods:**
- Accessibility
- Usability Testing
- Feedback integration
- Interactive Design
- Retrospectives
- Release

**Outcome:** Solution Scalability,
Low-Res Wireframes

## **What is the process of UI?**
UX has e key phases: design and testing. UI design precedes the development of the product's functional elements. UI design is the creation of the finished interface; its focus is on the visual and emotional feel of the product. UI design establishes the layout, colors, typography and interactivity to visually communicate the flow of the screens in an intuitive manner. The UI design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to changing user needs.
### **Design**
After ideation is design —this puts your ideas to the test. During design you will commit to internally validated ideas and test those ideas with users. After you complete the design process, you will likely bring what you’ve learned back to step 2 (ideation) and repeat this step again. This can happen multiple times.

**Methods:**
- Design Sprints
- Style Guides

### **Validate (Test, Prototype)**
After you design, you will test to validate your design ideas. During testing you will test your ideas with users. After you complete the testing process, you will likely bring what you’ve learned back to step 1 (design) and repeat this step again. This can happen multiple times.

# **Practical Applications and Design Thinking**
UX and UI are driven by Design Thinking, which refers to creative strategies designers use during the process of designing. This approach is also useful to resolve issues outside of professional design practice, such as in business, social, or personal contexts. There are 5 keys to design thinking, and you can apply them to your everyday life like the store analogy in the introduction.

* **Empathize—** When you design, you’re not primarily doing it for yourself. You’re doing it with other people's needs and desires in mind. Focus on the person or problem that you are serving. Find ways to serve them better. Help their loves be better each day. Empathize first.
* **Discover—** Try to narrow down your problem to the root cause. Jump in with an open mind, without criticism or opinions. Seek to understand before you are understood.
* **Ideate–** Be imaginative, create ideas to solve the problem you identified in step 2.
* **Prototype–** Place the concept of being perfect aside. Embrace failure to master the process. Don’t be cautious.
**Test—** Cultivate self-awareness by asking yourself, “what do I really want to see or experience?” Never limit yourself.

# **Conclusion**
UI/UX is a fundamental aspect of our everyday life, understanding its fundametals produces the desire outcome. A good UI/UX design will ensure people continious use of our product while a bad one discourage users. Dain Miller a web developer said 'UI is the saddle, stirrup and the reins, UX is the feeling you get being able to ride a horse'
