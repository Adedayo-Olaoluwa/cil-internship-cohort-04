## Computing Services
**Computing Services** means all information technology and computer systems (including Software, application service provider services, hosted computing services, information technology and telecommunication hardware and other equipment) relating to the transmission, storage, maintenance, organization, presentation, generation, processing or analysis of data and information whether or not in electronic format.

### Kinds of Computing Services
- Applications
- Data
- Runtime
- Middleware
- OS (Operating System)
- Vitualization
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking

### Tpypes of Computing Services
- **System Computing Services i.e. Traditional IT:**  In traditional IT, an organization consumes IT assets - hardware, system software, development tools, applications etc. - by purchasing them, installing them, managing them and maintaining them in its own on-premises data center.

- **Cloud Computing Services:** In cloud computing, the cloud service provider owns, manages and maintains the assets; the customer consumes them via an Internet connection, and pays for them on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis, they are so called 'As a service'. 'As a service' models refers to the way IT assets are consumed in these offerings.

#### Cloud Computing Service Models
***IaaS, or infrastructure as a service,*** is on-demand access to cloud-hosted physical and virtual servers, storage and networking - the backend IT infrastructure for running applications and workloads in the cloud. Cloud computing is offered in three (not limited to three) different service models which each satisfy a unique set of business requirements. Thus,

***PaaS, or platform as a service,*** is on-demand access to a complete, ready-to-use, cloud-hosted platform for developing, running, maintaining and managing applications.It offers the runtime environment for applications.

***SaaS, or software as a service,*** is on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application software. 

### Categories of Various Computing Services to Cloud Computing Models
| Computing Services | Cloud Computing Models|  |  |
|--------------------| -----------------------| :--- | --- |
|					 | SaaS   | PaaS   | IaaS |	
| Applications | Provide | Don't Provide | Don't Provide|
|Data | Provide | Don't Provide | Don't Provide|
|Runtime | Provide | Provide | Dont't Provide |
| Middleware | Provide | Provide | Don't Provide|
| OS | Provide | Provide | Provide|
| Virtualization | Provide | Provide | Provide |
| Servers| Provide | Provide |  Provide |
| Storage | Provide | Provide | Provide |
| Networking | Provide | Provide | Provide |

## NB: 
- ***provide*** here, the cloud services providers of the 'As a Service' model owns, manages, and maintains the assets while the customer consumes them via the internet as mentioned earlier.
- ***Don't provide*** here, the consumer of the 'As a service' model, owns, manually configure, manages, maintains and operates the assets.
