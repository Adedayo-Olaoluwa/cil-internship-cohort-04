# Q1. Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model

The TCP/IP model is a networking Model to standardize computer networking. Networking models, sometimes called network architecture or network blueprint, refers to a comprehensive set of rules designed to govern how data is shared between different computers.

Each set of rules individually describes one small function required for a network; collectively, these rules describe everything required for different computers to communicate with each other.

The TCP/IP model determines how a computer should be connected to the internet and how data should be shared between different computers.

The original TCP/IP model is made up of 4 layers, which includes

1. Application layer
2. Transport Layer
3. Internet layer
4. Link Layer

The TCP/IP model has been updated, and the current TCP/IP model has 5 layers which includes

1. Application layer
2. Transport Layer
3. Network layer
4. Data Link Layer
5. Physical Layer

Like the OSI model, the TCP IP model is numbered from the bottom to the top, but the direction depends on whether you are sending or receiving.

# Application layer

The application layer allows the user to interact with the application. Software application like web browser and email client depends on the Application layer to initiate communication.

The application layer provides services for network applications with the help of the application layer protocol to perform user activities.

These protocol form the basics for various network services e.g

- FTP: File Transfer
- HTTPS/HTTP: Web Surfing
- SMTP: Sending Emails
- TELNET: Virtual Terminal

# Transport Layer

The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end communication and ensures error-free data delivery.

It creates and maintains communication between the application process on the host.
The transport layer performs error control on the receiving end by ensuring that the data received is complete and requesting retransmission if it isn't.

The most commonly used transport protocols are Transport Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

# Network layer

the network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units called packets.

It also connects independent networks to transport the packets across network boundaries. The network layer protocols are IP and Internet Control Message Protocol, which are used for error reporting.

The network layer's primary functions are logical addressing, routing, and path determination.

# Data Link Layer

Data Link Layer protocol is responsible for delivering traffic on a single network segment or LAN, which means delivery within a single subnet.

The standard data Link protocol is Ethernet and a point-to-point network.

# Physical Layer

It is responsible for physically transmitting and receiving data. This Layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches.

Data from the application layer has been segmented by the transport layer and placed into a packet by network layer and frame by data link layer to a sequence of 0 and 1 (Binary).

The physical Layer converts this binary sequence into a signal and transmits it over local media.

It can be electric signals in the case of copper cable, light signals in the case of optical fiber, and radio signals in the case of air.

The signal generated by the physical Layer depends on the type of media used to connect to devices.

# Q2. What are the NS IP addresses for Google, Facebook and Tesla?

### Facebook

- 102.132.101.35

### Google

- 216.58.223.206
- 216.58.223.228

### Tesla

- 104.89.119.127
- 184.50.204.169
- 104.86.104.55
- 184.30.18.203
- 23.201.26.71
- 2.20.92.122

### Breakdown the following RFC 1918 IPv4 address range into exactly 4 subnetwork with no address left over.

10.10.10.0
192.168.0.0
172.168.1.0

- class A - 10.10.10.0 default subnet of 255.0.0.0 CIDR /8
- class B - 172.168.1.0 default subnet of 255.255.0.0 /16
- class C - 192.168.0.0 default subnet of 255.255.255.0 /24

Breakdown into 4 subnets 256/4 = 64

# Q3 Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's benefits in software development.

### SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

Software development is the process programmers use to build computer programs. The process, also known as the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), includes several phases that provide a method for building products that meet technical specifications and user requirements.

### WHAT IS SCRUM

Scrum is an agile management framework that teams use to self-organize and work towards a common goal. It describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles for efficient project delivery.

Work is done in short cycles called sprints, and the team meets daily to discuss current tasks and any roadblocks that need clearing. Scrum is a method for managing projects that allow for rapid development and testing, especially within a small team.

### BENEFITS OF SCRUM IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT.

- With Scrum, there is adaptability. Changes can be supported and integrated into a project currently in progress.

- Scrum creates an environment of support and trust, increasing people's motivation and morale.

- Frequent reflection points are built into the framework that allows team members to review their progress. Project managers use insights from these review meetings for estimation and future planning. As a result, projects can run more efficiently, within budget, and on schedule.

## From the Agile Manifesto, complete the following:

Individuals and interactions over .....
Working software over .....
Customer collaboration over .....
Responding to change over ......

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.
