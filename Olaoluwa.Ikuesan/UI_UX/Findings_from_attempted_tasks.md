### **Answers**
From the tutorials and associated tasks given, the following questions and their associated responses arose.

***What is user experience (UX)?***

User experience (UX) design is the process of designing effective, efficient, highly usable, inclusive, and even delightful experiences for human beings. In the context of the field of UX design, this typically relates to digital product experiences—meaning mobile apps and websites.

To put it even more simply, UX design is the process of designing great digital product experiences that work well for the people who use those products.

UX is used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context. Depending on how the product or service is designed, the experience can range from delightful to downright frustrating!

***What is user experience design (UXD)?***

User experience design, or UXD, considers each and every element that shapes the user experience. It’s all about designing specifically for the needs of the user or customer, looking at things like ease of use, quality, and efficiency.

***Where does UX design come from?***

The term “UX” was first coined in the 1990s by Dr. Donald Norman, an electrical engineer and cognitive scientist at Apple. A pioneer of user-centered design, Norman emphasized the importance of designing based on the needs and goals of the end user. In doing so, he introduced the term “user experience”, which, in Norman’s own words, is meant to encompass “all aspects of a person’s experience with a system, from the materials used to the interaction itself (physical or digital), along with the interface, graphics, and orientation.”

***What do good and bad UX look like?***

Good UX is one which can be used seamlessly and intuitively without any manual while bad UX is one that can not be easily used by the end users. Good UX takes into account accessibility, findability and usability of the product by users.

***What is the typical UX design process?****

The UX design process can generally be divided into four key phases: **research, design, testing, and implementation.** 

Based on these phases, UX designers tend to follow a certain sequence for each project: carrying out user research, analyzing their findings, defining user personas, mapping out user flows, creating wireframes and prototypes, conducting user testing, and finally, handing the designs over for visual design and development.

***How do UX designers and UI designers work together?***

From the lessons, it was noted that visual design doesn’t typically come under the UX design process; that’s the role of the user interface (UI) designer. So, once a UX designer has taken care of the layout and information architecture, the UI designer steps in to handle the aesthetics.

UI designers also have a solid understanding of the user’s needs and goals, but their speciality lies in the user’s visual experience. Based on the UX designer’s wireframes and prototypes, they design all the visual aspects of the product interface, such as color, typography, and spacing, as well as the interactive touchpoints that the user encounters, such as buttons and scrollbars.

***The UX design quadrant model***

On top of the foundational UX design skills (like prototyping, user empathy, user testing, etc.), many UX designers also choose to specialize in one or two areas depending on their interests, skills, and the needs of their employer.

A great way to look at the specializations of UX design is through the lens of the quadrant model, which groups the field into four main disciplines:
- Experience Strategy (ExS)
- User Research (UR)
- Information Architecture (IA)
- Interaction Design (IxD)


**What are some other specialist career paths for UX designers?**

UX design is an ever-growing field, offering plenty of opportunity to both specialize and diversify. Amongst these are:

- UX writer: Written copy plays a crucial part in the overall user experience, and just like all the visual touchpoints, the words on the product interface also need to be designed! Dedicated UX writers are increasingly sought-after, and this is a great potential career path if you want to combine copywriting with UX. You can learn all about what a UX writer actually does in this guide.

- Voice designer: The global voice and speech recognition market is estimated to be worth a whopping $31.82 billion by 2025—meaning that voice designers are in high demand! Voice designers apply UX principles in order to create user-friendly interactions with voice technology. They conduct research, create personas and placeonas, define the information architecture, and design user flows, scripts, and dialogs. You can learn more about the role of the voice designer here.

- UX developer: Traditionally, designers and developers belong to two very separate camps. These days, however, more and more designers are choosing to pick up some frontend coding skills and become so-called UX developers. A UX developer is best described as part-designer, part-developer, and the role generally involves some visual design skills, too.

- UX/UI designer: UX design is all about how the overall interaction with the product feels for the user, while UI is concerned with the visual, interactive elements. Still, it’s not uncommon for UX designers to pick up UI design skills.

***What are the most important soft skills for UX designers?***

Soft skills are a combination of personal attributes and social and communication skills. They’re harder to measure than technical skills, but are increasingly valued in the workplace. As a UX designer, one will often work on cross-team and cross-functional products; this is where soft skills can make the most impact. Some of the most important soft skills as a UX designer are:

- Communication: UX designers spend a great deal of time presenting to clients and stakeholders, interviewing users, and collaborating with developers and fellow designers. So, the number one skill to have as a UX designer is communication—and it goes both ways! Whether written, verbal, or visual, UX designers need to be able to articulate their ideas clearly while also being an active and engaged listener.
- Empathy: Empathy is at the heart of user-centric design. Whenever decisions are being made about the direction of a product or service, it’s your role as the UX designer to advocate for the users. You need to step into the user’s shoes and view the product through their eyes. What are their pain-points? What are their goals? What do they want to achieve when using the product? Empathy will allow you and anyone else you’re working with to make better design decisions, so it should be incorporated in a UX designer's design process from the very beginning..
- Organization: UX designers work with a great many documents and design deliverables—from design briefs, research findings, and interview results, to wireframes, prototypes, and design specifications. UX designers therefore need to be extremely organized; not just for their own efficiency, but for the rest of the team, too. Nearly all of their work is eventually distributed to other team members and stakeholders! As a UX designer, you’ll have a very varied workload, so you’ll need to stay organized and on top of things.

**What are the most important hard skills for UX designers?**

Hard skills are the technical and functional skills required by a job. Unlike soft skills, they’re job-specific, and they’re usually measured by performance. Some of these are:

- User research: Thorough research can be the deciding factor between a great and a terrible user experience. User research (and your analysis of this research) plays a crucial role in discovering user needs and building that all-important empathy. As a UX designer, you’ll carry out user testing, interviews, surveys, questionnaires, and focus groups, so you’ll need to refine your research and analysis skills.
- Information architecture: Information architecture refers to the organization of information in an effective, accessible, and meaningful way. With the sheer amount of information now available to us on the web, the role of information architecture has become all the more significant. UX designers must learn the principles of information architecture in order to produce and implement site maps, label systems, and organize navigational structures in a way that feels intuitive to the user.
- Wireframing and prototyping: Another key component of the UX designer skillset: creating wireframes and prototypes. Wireframes and prototypes allow UX designers to quickly communicate and test their ideas, and can range from low-fidelity hand-drawn models to high-fidelity digital mockups.

**UX design skillset in summary**

**What is a UX design portfolio?**

A UX design portfolio is an online exhibition of a UX designer’s work. It’s a personal website that introduces you as a designer and showcases a selection of projects that you’ve worked on. The aim of your UX portfolio is to demonstrate your process—not just the end result. Unlike other design fields that focus on the visual elements of design, UX is more concerned with how you got there: How did you identify and solve the user problem? What processes did you go through?

**What is a UX design case study?**
As part of a UX designer's portfolio, case studies help tell the story of a particular project. They use both text and images to showcase an entire UX process—from discovery to solution and everything in between. At the end of each case study, UX designers can also include outcomes and success metrics; in other words, what impact did the project have? How did you improve the experience for the end user and for the business?

Case studies are crucial in showing (and telling) potential employers and clients how you think and work as a UX designer. They present a logical, easy-to-follow narrative, inviting the reader to see how you go about solving user problems.
