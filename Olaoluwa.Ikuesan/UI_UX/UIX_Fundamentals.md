**Introduction to UI and UX**

**UX** design refers to the term “user experience design”, while **UI** design stands for “user interface design”. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different aspects of the product development process and the design discipline.

**UX Design**

User experience design is a human-first way of designing products. Don Norman, a cognitive scientist and co-founder of the Nielsen Norman Group Design Consultancy, is credited with coining the term “user experience” in the late 1990s. Here’s how he describes it:

*“User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products.”*

**UX and the Digital World**

Despite being a scientific term, its use since inception has been almost entirely within digital fields; one reason for this being that the tech industry started blowing up around the time of the term’s invention.

Essentially, UX applies to anything that can be experienced— be it a website, a coffee machine, or a visit to the supermarket. The “user experience” part refers to the interaction between the user and a product or service. User experience design, then, considers all the different elements that shape this experience.

**UI Design**
Despite it being an older and more practiced field, the question “What is user interface design?” is difficult to answer because of its broad variety of misinterpretations. While user experience is a conglomeration of tasks focused on the optimization of a product for effective and enjoyable use, user interface design is its complement; the look and feel, the presentation and interactivity of a product.

**UI and the Digital World**

Unlike UX, user interface design is a strictly digital term. A user interface is the point of interaction between the user and a digital device or product—like the touchscreen on your smartphone, or the touchpad you use to select what kind of coffee you want from the coffee machine.

In relation to websites and apps, UI design considers the look, feel, and interactivity of the product. It’s all about making sure that the user interface of a product is as intuitive as possible, and that means carefully considering each and every visual, interactive element the user might encounter.

**Key Differences Between UI and UX Design**

- **UX design** is all about identifying and solving user problems; **UI design** is all about creating intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing, interactive interfaces.

- **UX design** usually comes first in the product development process, followed by **UI**. The UX designer maps out the bare bones of the user journey; the UI designer then fills it in with visual and interactive elements.

- **UX** can apply to any kind of product, service, or experience; **UI** is specific to digital products and experiences.

**Overview of a UX Designer's Responsibilities**

- Strategy and content:
    - Competitor analysis
    - Customer analysis and user research
    - Product structure and strategy
    - Content development

- Wireframing and prototyping:
    - Wireframing
    - Prototyping
    - Testing and iteration
    - Development planning
- Execution and analytics
    - Coordination with UI designers
    - Coordination with developers
    - Tracking goals and Integration
    - UX analysis and iteration

So part-marketer, part-designer, part-project manager; the UX role is complex, challenging and multi-faceted. In fact, the role of the UX designer varies hugely depending on the type of company they’re working in.

UX Designers employ the design thinking process to find and test creative solutions to practical problems. The design thinking process in UX Design is an iterative process comprising five stages, namely:

1. **Empathize:**
In the first stage of the process, the UX designer connects with product users (or potential users) to understand their needs and goals, and to get a sense of what problems or pain points could use some design thinking magic to solve. Much of this stage consists of UX research—user interviews and surveys, as well as other forms of research to help generate user-centered data.

2. **Define:**
The second stage of the process is all about organizing the research results, sorting through the data, and looking at it from various perspectives. The goal is to identify patterns and actionable insights that will help the UX designer to formulate solutions. This is where things like affinity diagrams, user personas, and journey maps come into play—among other key deliverables. The goal of this stage is to clearly define which problem(s) to focus on for the time being.

3. **Ideate:**
The ideation stage is where UX designers come up with as many ideas as they can for how to solve the problem they’ve defined. There are any number of ideation methods they might use to accomplish this (and we’ll explore some of those in Tutorial 3), but the goal is to ideate without too many constraints or filters—no idea is a bad idea. Later in this stage, the UX designer can work with others in their team or company to figure out which idea works best for the user and best meets business goals.

4. **Prototype:**
In the fourth stage of the process, the UX designer turns the top idea(s) into reality—to a certain extent. The goal of this stage is to create a working model (known as a prototype) of the idea to see how it will operate, and to work out any major issues in the design before moving forward.

5. **Test:**
Finally, the UX designer tests the prototype with actual users to understand whether or not the solution meets users’ needs the way they expected, to find out if there are aspects of the problem that they’ve overlooked, and to see if the solution itself creates any new issues to be resolved.

But this isn’t where the process ends. In its truest form, the Design Thinking process is recursive and iterative—meaning that it repeats over and over again, and that the stages won’t always be followed in this particular order.

**Overview of UI Designer's Responsibilities**

- The look and feel of the product:
    - Customer analysis
    - Design research
    - Branding and graphic development
    - User guides and storylines
- Responsiveness and interactivity:
    - UI prototyping
    - Interactivity and animation
    - Adaptation to all device screen sizes
    - Implementation with developer

As a visual and interactive designer, the UI role is crucial to any digital interface and, for customers, a key element to trusting a brand. While the brand itself is never solely the responsibility of the UI designer, its translation to the product is.
