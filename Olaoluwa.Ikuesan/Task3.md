# Thursday's Task on GIT
## Step by Step Process
- The GitHub repository was cloned
- A branch was then created with my ID
- A sub-folder with my name came next
- And I populated a Markdown file inside it

The git commands used for this task were git clone 'url', git checkout -b 'ID', as well as commands like git add, git status and git branch.
