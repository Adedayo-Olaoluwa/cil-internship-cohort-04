# HTML and CSS Task

A task in fulfilment of Frontend web development internship at Cecure Intelligence Limited.

## Resources

A live version of [Max Website](https://004task5.netlify.app/).

A video demonstration of the web pages both in desktop and mobile viewports available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TQKRGlXGWZPtQTCOUzJGzRBUGfyFXueL/view?usp=drivesdk).

The instructions and design followed for the project availabele [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RI5_93_3wtIA-A5DWB6GXTqgwws1aC2z?usp=sharing).

## My process

### Designed with

- I arranged the screnshots into a Figma file in the order they are to appear.
- I also use the mask option to download some of the images from the screenshots. These are available in my assets page on Figma.
- [Figma design available here](https://www.figma.com/file/OtAgVaRUZ7xs63Ww2zYbgQ/CIL-Task?node-id=0%3A1).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

I learned to use netlify to host my static pages. This is in the wake of Heroku cancelling their free-tier plan.
