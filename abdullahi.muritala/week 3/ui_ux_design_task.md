# Introduction to UI/UX Design

## Twitter case study

With a mission to browse websites and apps that I use frequently and make a note of intuitive or frustrating observations. I picked the Twitter mobile app.

### Good UX

- Usability and Usefulness: Immediately after I open the mobile app, I am welcomed with the latest feed from my timeline. This ensures that I hardly miss any latest information or gist.
- Navigation: Almost all the app's important features can be reached from the default page.
- Findable: Comfortable location of the button to add a new tweet. It’s just a few inches away from the natural position of my right thumb.

### Bad UX

- The immutability of tweets and direct messages is another recurring bad UX that I think Twitter should change.
- Ads: Although Twitter needs to make a profit, the ads pop up when one least expects them. Recently, they haven’t even been personalized.
- The bottom navigation has gotten crowded because of the addition of communities. This will take a few months of getting used to.

## UI and UX fundamentals

### Introduction

User interface and user experience design are two terms often erroneously interpreted as one and the same. User experience (UX) design is more concerned with designing the overall feel and experience a user has with a product. In contrast, UI is more focused on designing how the product looks.

### User Interface (UI) Design

This is the process of creating digital products with special attention to aesthetics. How visually appealing a product is often affects the way users view it. Gone are the days of horrible color combinations with poor contrast. Nowadays, designers produce appealing and aesthetically pleasing interfaces for users to interact with.

A good design accomplishes the task at hand without calling attention to itself. Humans like order. Therefore we unconsciously look for alignment, hierarchy, order, grouping, and color schemes in every website we visit. This is why a layman will tell you a website is badly designed without pointing to a particular cause.

### User Experience (UX) Design

Coined by Dr. Donald Norman in the 1990s, user experience is “all aspects of a person’s experience with a system, from the materials used to the interaction itself (physical or digital), along with the interface, graphics, and orientation.”

User experience design puts into consideration every factor that affects the user’s experience. The whole process is designed around the user’s needs.

The process often starts with user research, which then leads to brainstorming and problem solving from the analyzed data. A wireframe—a sketch or digital mock-up of the product is then made. Prototypes of the product are given out to users to test out before handing over to designers and developers.

User experience design is important because:

- it fulfills the user’s needs.
- it provides a positive experience for the user that keeps them loyal to your brand.
- it reduces cost in the long run.
- it ensures customer satisfaction and improves the reputation of your brand.
- improves conversion and return on investments.

## To wrap up

Although the terms might be used together, and sometimes even have their roles advertised together, they are separate fields. With a UI designer focusing more on the looks and the UX designer emphasizing the feels.
