# Clinical Methods

The task was to describe a layered process that I am familiar with, similar to the OSI model. I was tempted to pick the TCP/IP model because of the layers' similarities. However, I opted out of this because I am only vaguely familiar with the process. Instead, I decided to write about clinical methods because of my medical background. This is the set of layered processes a doctor goes through to diagnose and treat a patient successfully. Sir Robert Hutchinson formally documented the process in his 1897 book, Clinical Methods, an integrated approach to clinical practice.

- History Taking: This is the process of compiling background information about the patient. The objective of this layer is to enable the clinician to organize the patient's story, filter the information, and extract the ones that may be relevant to the patient's current state of health.

- Examination: This layer has four sub-layers: inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. The doctor inspects where the lesion is located or the organ that seems to be diseased. He then performs maneuvers like touching and percussing to elicit signs that could indicate the disease state. If necessary, he then listens with his stethoscope for any abnormalities. After this layer, the physician will have a list of possible diseases called differential diagnosis.

- Investigation: This could also range from simple bedside tests to more sophisticated ones like CT scans, MRI, or organ biopsies. The aim is to confirm the most suspected disease entity and rule out the others.

- Diagnosis: After aggregating the information from the three layers above. The physician then arrives at a diagnosis. This critical layer informs the patient's treatment.

- Treatment: This step of the clinical method is based on the information from the above layer. The treatment could range from pills, injections, extraction of some diseased organs, surgeries, transfusion, transplants, etc.
