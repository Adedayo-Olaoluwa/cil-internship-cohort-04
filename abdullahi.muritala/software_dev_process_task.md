# Software Development Process

## 1. Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of its benefits in software development.

Scrum is a strategy for software product development that organizes developers as teams to create ready-for-market products. It follows agile software development principles.

The product owner provides a list of features called the product backlog. The scrum team then picks the highest ranked feature to work on for a sprintâ€”this should last between 2 to 4 weeks. During the sprint, team members have daily meetings to discuss what was achieved and any roadblocks. A scrum master keeps the team focused on the goal.

Each task ends with a sprint review, and the team picks another feature from the product backlog. This cycle continues either until the budget runs out or the deadline is reached.

### Benefits of Scrum

- Speed
- High morale among developers because of freedom to make decisions.
- A market-ready product is produced after each sprint.
- There are often higher returns on investments.
- Testing is spread throughout the development process.
