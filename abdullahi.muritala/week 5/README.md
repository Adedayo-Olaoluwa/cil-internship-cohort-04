# Todo List App TypeScript

A task in fulfilment of Frontend web development internship at Cecure Intelligence Limited.

## Resources

A live version of [Todo List App](https://004-typescript-todo.netlify.app/).

A video demonstration of the web pages both in desktop and mobile viewports available [on google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sOiCMEboDyg5gll-1y2VL4S7dWnQm9hU/view?usp=sharing).

The designs followed were culled from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies.

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Available at (http://localhost:8080/)[http://localhost:8080/]

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run watch`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It also watches for recent changes.\
It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- TypeScript
- Webpack
- [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- Netlify CLI for CI/CD and Hosting

### What I learned

- I refreshed my knowledge of webpack configuration.
- I came to appreciate how much tooling comes with create-react-app out of the box.
- I learnt to use the Netlify CLI for continuous integration.
