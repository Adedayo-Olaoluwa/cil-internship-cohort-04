## **UI AND UX FUNDAMENTALS** ##

UI design and UX design are often confused terms in digital products and services. 

They are usually placed and viewed from the surface tending to mean the same thing but one is entirely different from the other. Let’s say, they are two sides of the same coin.

UI design refers to the user interface while UX design refers to the user experience. UI is about how a product looks while UX is about how a product feels.

**WHAT IS UI DESIGN?**

UI design is the process of making interfaces in software or digital devices with a focus on aesthetics (style). UI design is the process of creating products that are both useful and easy to use, by thinking about users’ needs and how they will interact with the product – this covers everything from buttons and icons to drop-down menus and slides to text fields and images.

### **Why is the user interface design important?** ##

UI is important because it makes or breaks customer base. It can be difference between customers staying on a product or leaving it.

The importance of investing in good user interface design is for business reasons: if you want people to buy from you, use your website, download your app, you have to make sure they do not get frustrated and leave before they convert.

The UI design is the actual look and feel of the website. It is what we see on the screen and interact with. So, it is important to have a beautiful and consistent UI to create an enjoyable user experience (UX). But what is UX?


### WHAT IS UX DESIGN? ##

Let us imagine a charming and alluring website but functions poorly like a Ferrari with a faulty engine.  
UX design is the difference between a website or an app people like to visit and the one they can’t wait to leave.

UX designers are tasked with shaping the overall user experience of a website or web application focusing on how it feels, functions and looks.

User experience (UX) is the process of creating products that provide meaningful and relevant experience to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspect of branding, design, usability and function. It is process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product.

UX design focuses on the end-user experience, including any interaction the user has with the interface. It is about creating something that meets the needs of users and provides them with value, not just something that looks nice.

### WHY IS UX IMPORTANT? ###

Take a website for example, UX design includes everything from aesthetics to whether or not a site is usable and it plays a vital role in the company’s success. Customers who have positive experiences are likely to return while those with negative experience will not return.

UX designer solve usability first, and aesthetics second.


### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UI/UX ###

Looking for a difference between UI/UX from a user perspective is like asking the difference between cake and the contents the cake is made up of? There is no difference. Cake is made up of all sorts of contents that when combined make the cake.

Just as the user experience is made up of a bunch of different components, user interface design being just one of them, when combined makes up the user experience.

UI is the icing, the plates, the flour, the flavor and the presentation. UX is the reason we are serving the cake in the first place and why people would rather eat it than doughnuts.

UI and UX go hand in hand, we cannot have one without the other. 

From the perspective of a user, there is no difference. The experience is what we feel and think when we interact with a product or a service. 

But from the perspective of a designer, there is a big difference. Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different parts of the process and the design discipline. Where UX design is more analytical and technical field, UI design is closer to what we refer to as graphic design, though the responsibilities are somewhat more complex.

UI and UX are often talked about together but each are very different.

UI designer focuses on making things look good. They are concerned with aesthetics and creating a product that has a consistent style and looks that appeal to users. A UI will work closely with a UX designer to make sure that their designs fit in with the requirements of the UX designer.

UX designer focuses on making sure that a product is easy for people to use. They are concerned with optimizing the flow of information – how easy it is for users to get from point A to point B, for example. 

UX design is the process of building website or app that is both functional and intuitively easy to use. It focuses on the satisfaction aspect of a user’s experience.

UI design, on the other hand, focuses on making sure screen looks its best visually and serves its purpose in an overall product.

UX is the way users feels when interacting with your product or service. A good UX design create a positive experience that keeps users loyal to the product or brand.



### CONLUSION ###

UI and UX work together but are different. UX design is more analytical. It’s rooted in cognitive behaviour and human psychology. UI design software is focused more on the visuals—or whether a product is aesthetically pleasing.

The UX design process is the framework or strategy that guides how a designer or team of designers tackles a project. It’s the series of steps or actions a designer takes to best solve a problem for their user.
Some examples of this would be conducting user research, defining, ideation, prototyping  and testing.

The UI process is the steps and actions that are taken to turn UX design into reality. The UI process revolves around the definition of style and brand guidelines that must be followed to create a cohesive experience between all your products. 
Some examples of this would be defining color palettes and typography, creating basic elements such as buttons and icons, designing page layouts and templates, and developing style guides.

UX is more to do with the actual functionality and content of a website or app, while UI is the look and feel and how people interact with it.
