A layered process similar to the OSI model is the TCP / IP model.
TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol.
IP stands for Internet Protocol.
The TCP / IP protocol combines the application, presentation and session layers of the OSI model into a single application layer.
The data link and physical layers of the OSI model are also combined to create a single network interface layer in the TCP / IP model.
The TCP / IP model has 4 layers: application, transport, internet and network interface unlike the OSI model which has 7 layers.
