##### What is scrum in software development?

- Scrum is an agile software development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal

##### Benefits of scrum in software development

- Each sprint produces a product that is ready for market even though the project is ongoing.

- The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be on the market.

- Scrum projects often realize a higher return on investment (ROI)

- Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.

- Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.

- Increased customer satisfaction.

- Employees whose ideas are valued are vastly more productive than those who are ordered to follow a set of rules.

##### From the Agile Manifesto

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

2. Working software over over comprehensive documentation.

3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

4. Responding to change over following a plan.
