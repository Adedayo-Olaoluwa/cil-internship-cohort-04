## Findings from the resource

- User experience, or UX, is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context.
  The term “UX” was first coined in the 1990s by Dr. Donald Norman, an electrical engineer and cognitive scientist at Apple.

- User Interface or UI designers also have a solid understanding of the user’s needs and goals, but their speciality lies in the user’s visual experience. Based on the UX designer’s wireframes and prototypes, they design all the visual aspects of the product interface, such as color, typography, and spacing, as well as the interactive touchpoints that the user encounters, such as buttons and scrollbars.

##### Difference between “Good UX’ and “Bad UX”

Good UX adds better usability, interaction, visual appeal and information structure to your product, by which increases users satisfaction and sales in return. With good UX design, users are more likely to be able to complete their goals with lesser effort and without frustration.

The opposite holds true for bad UX where it takes more effort, time and requirements for users to get what they want.

##### UX design process can generally be divided into four key phases:

1. **User research**: As a UX designer, a user-centered approach is absolutely crucial; you need to understand what your users need, how they think, and how they behave.

2. **Design**: Once the steps in the user journey have been mapped out, I can start to define how the content on each page should be organized, as well as how these pages can fit together in a way that’s intuitive and easy for the user to navigate. This is where wireframes and prototypes come in.

3. **User testing**: Just like user research, it’s important to test your designs on real users; this way, you get authentic feedback from those who will actually be using the product. Testing also makes sense from a business perspective—you’ll catch any major design flaws before going into the development phase, which saves considerable time and money for the company!

4. **Implementation**: This is done by the UI designer. Based on the UX designer’s wireframes and prototypes, they design all the visual aspects of the product interface.

##### What is a UX design portfolio?

A UX design portfolio is an online exhibition of a UX designer’s work. It’s a personal website that introduces you as a designer and showcases a selection of projects that you’ve worked on.
